# export-visio-to-SVG-macro
Visio macro to export all foreground pages for all open visio documents to SVG

Adapted from http://www.visguy.com/2006/09/18/export-all-pages-in-document/

Save this in a blank stencil file with macros enabled (.vssm).

Open all the vsd and vsdx files you want to convert along with the stencil file.

Run the macro from the stencil file (you'll need to select the stencil file from the macro window).

Files will be exported to the folder where the macro stencil file is saved to.
